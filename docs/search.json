In over 20 years of experience (in Italy and in the US), I have worked on the entire analytic cycle (data collection-analysis-presentation) for several research projects applied to the field of economic development and the evaluation of public economic policies.\nYou can learn more about my background and academic publications via the links below, or on my CV. \n\nAs a freelance consultant, I currently support institutional clients (like the Italian Government), academic researchers and individual professionals in their statistics and data analysis endeavors. With my contribution I bring an analytical foundation to projects, and help making data-driven decision regardless of the sector, core business or size of the organization. I have also successfully delivered talks and workshops on statistics and reproducible quantitative research.\n\nThis website showcases some of my recent projects, mostly involving R programming for data analysis and/or the creation of static websites for data and/or technical content dissemination (in English üá∫üá∏ and Italian üáÆüáπ).\n\nFeel free to reach out if you think I can collaborate with you or your team with any statistics, data analysis, or R projects.\n\n \n  \n   \n  \n    \n     Email\n  \n  \n    \n     LinkedIn\n  \n  \n      Google Scholar\n  \n  \n      Research Gate\n  \n  \n      Orcid\n  \n  \n    \n     Github"
