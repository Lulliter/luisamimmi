The workshop is offered as part of a summer school for EU doctoral biology students, hosted by the Radboud Center for Mitochondrial Medicine, in Nijmegen, Netherlands. My sister (M.

My working hypothesis is that often slogans involves a progressive detachment of words/phrases from their original meaning, so ‚ÄúWhy‚Äù and ‚Äúhow‚Äù does such a deviation between words and reality occur?"

Specifically data were taken from the ESIF 2014-2020 Finance Implementation Details (99js-gm52) dataset, then drilled down to programs under the ERDF (European Regional Development Fund). This was also an opportunity to learn some interective datavisualization tools in R (e.g.¬†reactable).\n\n\n\n[R notes]: Cluster analysis (October 2022)\nHere is a tutorial I wrote as I was learning how to implement cluster analysis in R.\nHTML page |"
