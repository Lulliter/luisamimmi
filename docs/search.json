These are heavily used in the policy debate and strategic planning and I am curious to explore patterns of their occurrence using project documents as input data. \n\n\nPosition paper on city government ‚ÄúIdee per Pavia‚Äù (April 2024)\n Project website |  Source Code | (in Italian üáÆüáπ)\nThis is webpage I created to disseminate a position paper that I co-authored with the members of the Catholic Social Action Office of the Diocese of Pavia (my hometown in Italy). The report is meant as a tool to promote open and constructive dialogue on several urban planning issues and proposals in view of the upcoming municipal elections of June 2024."

Specifically data were taken from the ESIF 2014-2020 Finance Implementation Details (99js-gm52) dataset, then drilled down to programs under the ERDF (European Regional Development Fund). This was also an opportunity to learn some interective datavisualization tools in R (e.g.¬†reactable).\n\n\n\n[R notes]: Cluster analysis (October 2022)\nHere is a tutorial I wrote as I was learning how to implement cluster analysis in R.\n HTML page"
