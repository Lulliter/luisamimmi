### Technical writing \| Editing

I am a native Italian🇮🇹 speaker but I have published extensively in English🇺🇸 ---including in peer-reviewed journals--- as I lived/studied/worked in the USA for 14 years. I also have conversational knowledge of Spanish🇪🇸 and Portuguese🇧🇷.

Hence, I can effectively assist also with:

✔️ Outlining an article or technical/business report\
✔️ Editing and/or proofreading technical reports, theses and academic articles\
✔️ Revising and improving CVs, cover letters or documents for job applications\
✔️ Preparing and/or revising grant proposals\
✔️ Automating the preparation of recurring reports via scripted programming (`SQL`, `R`, `Markdown`), and tools for version control and automation (`git`, `make`)
