Over the years, I have worked on the entire analytic cycle for several research projects applied to the **public policy and economic development** domain fields. Below are the analytical tasks in which I have direct, hands-on expertise. 

## Data collection & analysis \| Statistics \| Econometrics

✔️ Design of **relational databases** to store complex data efficiently in compliance with normalization rules and keeping the logical flow of an evaluation in mind. Interaction with different types of databases (for M&E, CRM, etc.) to perform extract-transform-load (ETL) tasks\
<!--	 
		+ Databases using R https://db.rstudio.com/
		+ Learn packages such as: {dplyr, DBI, odbc, keyring, pool}
-->
✔️ **Webscraping** and retrieving data from different sources (via APIs, open repositories, web applications, census, etc.)\
✔️ **Data cleaning** & Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)\
<!--	 
		+ Learn the 20 most important functions for data wrangling
		+ Learn the 3 special data types (that 90% of data scientists struggle with)
		+ Create functions and iterate (using the purrr library)
		+ Learn packages such as: {DataExplorer, skimr, correlationfunnel, janitor}
-->
✔️ **Data visualization & dashboards** to identify outcomes frequency distributions, patterns, outliers\
<!--	 
		+ Master ggplot2 (visualize data like a pro)
		+ plotly
		+ Flexdashboard
		+ [Shiny Apps]
-->
✔️ Design and implementation of **surveys** (including sampling strategies and questionnaire instrument design)\
<!--	    
		+ Detect customer segments (using K-means)
		+ Predict prices for new products (using Machine Learning)
-->
✔️ Descriptive & inferential **statistics** for extrapolation of results to macro/population level, to estimate the net effect of intervention on a company, the economy and society\
✔️ **Regression** and multivariate analysis to identify (credible) causal links between interventions and outcomes\
✔️ **Communication of analysis' results/policy recommendation** in different forms suitable to target audience(s)---journal articles, reports, blog posts, slides, dashboards project websites\
<!--	 
		+ Learn packages such as: {RMArkdown, Shiny, Plumber APIs}
-->
✔️ Setting up a **transparent, collaborative & reproducible data science workflow** ---using `R/RStudio` and `git/GitHub`

> Over time, I have learned the benefits of properly storing and documenting each and every piece of the analytical process (raw data, code, derived data and analysis) so that you (and potential collaborators) can easily go back to it when needed: a.k.a. ***version control*** (see an inspiring [article by Jenny Bryan](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/344990307_Excuse_me_do_you_have_a_moment_to_talk_about_version_control/fulltext/5f9fb3b5299bf1b53e59cad5/Excuse-me-do-you-have-a-moment-to-talk-about-version-control.pdf?_sg%5B0%5D=a1lfXtxrZ7BRfcB5gDFXpYUHYDRpZ7fe7vqfIr1p18_cRUlIRVLQWaF_hGh4a8GKKoBGESpz4VuK63FxqQH1hw.c7hLP-njJDk2obi2Ij69MDNL7mKxKNMUMUacM-qYO8DOul_1ojUD4DYlmH3KmmjAtx1TizFf34LzDl3kJ17sCg&_sg%5B1%5D=GhJcqrYp-gtN3fgnCxfxGj2fE2d4UlYvHPsJphhY27zyarq5LKCIsQNAAkTLG1IX0Nttlb-UERMBzCRq16CpOo8BgwLRE2a0qnhdU2G-D2DW.c7hLP-njJDk2obi2Ij69MDNL7mKxKNMUMUacM-qYO8DOul_1ojUD4DYlmH3KmmjAtx1TizFf34LzDl3kJ17sCg&_iepl=)).

## Special Topics in Data Science

✔️ **Text mining**/NLP (Natural Language Processing) to organize and analyze unstructured text data (e.g. social media or legal documents), and identify meaningful patterns and insights\
✔️ **Geospatial Analysis**, spatial statistics and geospatial visualization to better understand   location-driven issues\
<!--	 
		+ Geocoding packages: {ggmap, osmdata,tmaptools, tidygeocoder, sf, sp}
		+ Geospatial Viz packages: {mapview, tigris, ggmap, osmplotr, tmap, cartography} 
			+ Interactive (JavaScript): {leaflet, plotly}

-->
✔️ Creating **Static Websites** (personal blog, project site, etc.)---using `R{distill}` -▶️ `GitHub Pages`-▶️ `AWS` (for vanity domain registration)\ 
<!-- ✔️ **Time Series Analysis** and **Forecasting** and **Anomaly Detection**: -->
<!-- 	+ Time Series Data Wrangling: timetk -->
<!-- 	+ Time Series Visualization: timetk -->
<!-- 	+ Feature Engineering: timetk -->
<!-- 	+ Convert between classes: timetk & tsbox -->
<!-- 	+ Generating Future Series: timetk -->
<!-- 	+ Prophet, ARIMA, Boost, ML: modeltime -->
<!-- 	+ Ensembles: modeltime.ensemble -->
<!-- 	+ Resampling & Backtesting: modeltime.resample -->
<!-- 	+ Deep Learning: modeltime.gluonts -->
<!-- 	+ H2O AutoML: modeltime.h2o -->
<!-- 	+ Identify anomalies: anomalize, timetk -->

## Technical writing \| Editing

I am a native Italian 🇮🇹 speaker but I have published extensively in English 🇺🇸 ---including in peer-reviewed journals--- as I lived/studied/worked in the USA for 14 years. I also have conversational knowledge of Spanish 🇪🇸 and Portuguese 🇧🇷.

Hence, I can effectively assist also with:

✔️ **Outlining an article** or technical/business report\
✔️ **Editing and/or proofreading** technical reports, theses and academic articles\
✔️ Revising and **improving CVs**, cover letters or documents for job applications\
✔️ Preparing and/or revising **grant proposals**\
✔️ Setting up **fast and automatic update of recurring reports** (e.g. quarterly sales, periodic fundraising outreach, etc.) via scripted programming (`SQL`, `R`, `Markdown`) and tools for version control and automation (`git`, `make`)\
