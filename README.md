> Websites made with Quarto


### What this is 
This is my professional website meant to showcase the kind of consulting services I provide 

### Resources 
+ In the absence of a better way ot create a multilingual website (for now at least), I followed the solution of [Arthur Rodrigues](https://github.com/avrodrigues/avrodrigues.github.io/tree/master) to use internal links to sections of the page 

### TO DO

+ Understand why footer moves up and down depending on page (probably should re-do mytheme.css from scratch)
+ [Deciding if this is still worth keeping up...]
	- Distill issues
	- overlapping with other websites
	- **CHECK cv_ENG_ITA before deleting **
