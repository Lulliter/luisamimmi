### What this is 
This is my professional website meant to showcase the kind of consulting services I provide 

### Resources 
+ Learn more about creating websites with Distill [here:](https://rstudio.github.io/distill/website.html)
+ Learn more about publishing to GitHub Pages [here:](https://rstudio.github.io/distill/publish_website.html#github-pages)
+ In the absence of a better way ot create a multilingual website (for now at least), I followed the solution of [Arthur Rodrigues](https://github.com/avrodrigues/avrodrigues.github.io/tree/master) to use internal links to sections of the page 

### TO DO

+ Understanf why footer moves up and down depending on page (probably should re-do theme.css from scratch)
