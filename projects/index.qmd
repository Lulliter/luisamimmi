## 2024

### Introductory workshop on *"R for Biostatistics"* (July 2024)

[(*WORK IN PROGRESS...*)]{style="color: #cc8400;"}

[Project website](https://R4biostats.com) \| [Code](https://github.com/Lulliter/R4biostats)

This website collects the materials for a four day workshop organized by [MITGEST Doctoral Network](https://www.mitgest.eu/) in July 2024. The workshop is offered as part of a summer School for EU doctoral students in life sciences, hosted by the Radboud Center for Mitochondrial Medicine, in Nijmegen, Netherlands. My sister designed the workshop and its lectures, and I contributed to it by preparing the 4 R practice sessions, and by building the dedicated website.

### Exploratory study on text analytics with R *"How slogans end up moving billions"* (2022 - ...)

[(*WORK IN PROGRESS...*)]{style="color: #cc8400;"}

[Project website](https://lulliter.github.io/slogan/) \| [Code](https://github.com/Lulliter/slogan) 

This is an ongoing project I started to explore text analytics to answer a question that I find extremely interesting and compelling: *What is the impact of slogans on policy decisions?* My working hypothesis is that often slogans involves a progressive detachment of words/phrases from their original meaning, so *"Why" and "how" does such a deviation between words and reality occur?* <br><br>

## 2023

<!-- ### Static website for press review (December 2023) -->

## 2022

### Exploratory Analysis of EU funds (ERDF, 2014-2020 cycle) spending (November 2022)

[Project website](https://lulliter.shinyapps.io/03_Analysis/) \| [Code](https://github.com/Lulliter/plan2implem)

This is a quick exploration of some EU structural funds aimed at verifying how much we have been able to disburse (given amounts planned and deemed eligible) for the 2014-2020 funding cycle. Specifically data are taken from the [ESIF 2014-2020 Finance Implementation Details](https://dev.socrata.com/foundry/cohesiondata.ec.europa.eu/99js-gm52) (99js-gm52) dataset, then I drill down to programs under the ERDF (European Regional Development Fund).
