This page contains a collection of miscellaneous projects (unrelated to my core research area), but mostly involving [{{< fa brands r-project >}}]{style="color: #3b7697;"} programming, and data analysis teaching (and learning ðŸ˜‰).

## 2024

### Introductory workshop on *"R for Biostatistics"* (July 2024)

[(***WORK IN PROGRESS...***)]{style="color: #cc8400;"}

[Project website](https://R4biostats.com) \| [Code](https://github.com/Lulliter/R4biostats)

This website collects the materials for a four day workshop organized by [MITGEST Doctoral Network](https://www.mitgest.eu/) in July 2024. The workshop is offered as part of a summer school for EU doctoral biology students, hosted by the Radboud Center for Mitochondrial Medicine, in Nijmegen, Netherlands. My sister ([M. Chiara Mimmi, Ph.D.](https://www.linkedin.com/in/maria-chiara-mimmi-b0aa9233/)), is in charge of the workshop, while I co-created the materials for the R practice sessions, plus the course website.

### Position paper on city government *"Idee per Pavia"* (April 2024)

[Project website](https://ideeperpavia.com/) \| [Code](https://github.com/Lulliter/ideeperpavia) | (in Italian ðŸ‡®ðŸ‡¹)

This is webpage I created to disseminate a position paper that I co-authored with the members of the Catholic Social Action Office of the Diocese of Pavia (my hometown in Italy). The report is meant as a tool to promote open and constructive dialogue on several urban planning issues and proposals in view of the upcoming municipal elections of June 2024.

## 2023
### *"Nerd help"* collection of programming tutorials  (2023)

[(***WORK IN PROGRESS...***)]{style="color: #cc8400;"}

[Project website](https://lulliter.github.io/nerd_help/me.html) \| [Code](https://github.com/Lulliter/nerd_help) 

I am a self-taught programmer (`R`, `git`, `Quarto`, `css`, etc.), so I put together this collection of notes on how to go about some tasks as I figured them out. While intended for personal use, I am glad if these tutorials can  be of help for others.  <br><br>

### Exploratory study on text analytics with R *"How slogans end up moving billions"* (2022 - ...)

[(***WORK IN PROGRESS...***)]{style="color: #cc8400;"}

[Project website](https://lulliter.github.io/slogan/) \| [Code](https://github.com/Lulliter/slogan) 

This is an ongoing project I started to explore text analytics to answer a question that I find extremely interesting and compelling: *What is the impact of slogans on policy decisions?* My working hypothesis is that often slogans involves a progressive detachment of words/phrases from their original meaning, so *"Why" and "how" does such a deviation between words and reality occur?* <br><br>

## 2022

### Exploratory Analysis of EU funds (ERDF, 2014-2020 cycle) spending (November 2022)

[Project website](https://lulliter.shinyapps.io/03_Analysis/) \| [Code](https://github.com/Lulliter/plan2implem)

This is a quick exploration of some EU structural funds aimed at verifying how much Italy has been able to disburse (given amounts planned and deemed eligible) for the 2014-2020 funding cycle. Specifically data were taken from the [ESIF 2014-2020 Finance Implementation Details](https://dev.socrata.com/foundry/cohesiondata.ec.europa.eu/99js-gm52) (99js-gm52) dataset, then drilled down to programs under the ERDF (European Regional Development Fund). This was also an opportunity to learn some interective datavisualization tools in R (e.g. `reactable`).

### [R notes]: Cluster analysis (October 2022)

Here is a tutorial I wrote as I was learning how to implement cluster analysis in R.
