::: {#hero-heading}
👋🏻 Hi there! 👋🏻

[I am Luisa, a Policy & Data Analyst, {{< fa mug-hot >}} coffee addict, and {{< fa brands r-project >}} enthusiast.]{style="color:  #7f6b00; font-weight: bold;"}

My professional focus lies at the intersection of *Economics*, *Public Policy* and *Data Science*. In over 20 years of experience (both in Italy and in the US), I have worked on the entire analytic cycle (data collection-analysis-presentation) for several research projects applied to the **public policy and economic development** domain fields. 

You can learn more about me and my prior work via the links below.
<!-- I gained extensive expertise in data collection-analysis-presentation, working in very different settings ---from private consulting to multilateral development banks, to NGOs and government. -->

--- 

As a **freelance consultant**, I currently support institutional clients (like the Italian Government), individual professionals and researchers in their quantitative analysis and informed decision-making by bringing an analytical foundation to projects, regardless of the sector, core business or size of the organization. I have also successfully delivered talks and workshops on statistics and reproducible quantitative research.

This website showcases some recent [**projects**](https://luisamimmi.org/projects/), mostly involving **R programming** for data analysis, and/or the creation of **static websites** for data and/or technical content dissemination (in English 🇺🇸 and Italian 🇮🇹). As a life-long learner, I enjoy studying new things and writing as a way of reflecting on interesting ideas or new skills I am learning. Hence this [**blog**](https://luisamimmi.org/blog/) page.   

[Feel free to reach out if you think I can help you or your team with your statistics, data analysis, or R projects.]{style="color:  #7f6b00; font-weight: bold;"}
