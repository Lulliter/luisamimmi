## Welcome!  

[I am a Policy & Data Analyst, freelance consultant, and {{< fa brands r-project >}} enthusiast.]{style="color:  #7f6b00; font-weight: bold;"}

My consulting services include **data and statistical analysis**, **quantitative program evaluation**, and **policy analysis**. I have extensively applied these skills across different sectors and contexts, working with multilateral development banks, central and local government policy-makers, academic researchers, small firms and non-profit organisations (mostly in Italy ðŸ‡®ðŸ‡¹ and in the US ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¸).  
I greatly enjoy teaching and have successfully delivered [**lectures and workshops**](https://luisamimmi.org/teaching/) on statistics, reproducible data analysis and visualization.
<!-- I bring an analytical foundation to projects, and help making data-driven decision regardless of the sector or size of the organization.   -->
<!-- As a life-long learner, I enjoy studying new things and writing as a way of reflecting on interesting ideas or new skills I am learning. Hence this [**blog**](https://luisamimmi.org/blog/) page.    -->

You can learn more about my background via my [**CV**](../cv), take a look at my [**published work**](https://luisamimmi.org/writings/), or peruse some illustrative [**projects**](https://luisamimmi.org/projects/), data tools and other learning experiments.


<!-- the [**research**](../writings) page,  -->
<!-- I gained extensive expertise in data collection-analysis-presentation, working in very different settings ---from private consulting to multilateral development banks, to NGOs and government. -->

[I am open to collaborate on projects involving data and statistical analysis, program evaluation, or R programming/training.]{style="color:  #7f6b00; font-weight: bold;"} 

<!-- If you want to work with me as a collaborator, supervisor, instructor, or public speaker, drop me a message: -->
