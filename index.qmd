## 👋🏻 Hi there! 👋🏻

[I am Luisa, a Policy & Data Analyst, freelance consultant, and {{< fa brands r-project >}} enthusiast.]{style="color:  #7f6b00; font-weight: bold;"}

My professional focus lies at the intersection of *Economics*, *Public Policy* and *Statistics*. In over 20 years of experience (in Italy and in the US), I have worked on the entire analytic cycle (data collection-analysis-presentation) for several research projects within the fields of **economic development and the impact evaluation of public economic policies**.   

You can learn more about my background and publications via the [**research**](../writings) page, my [**CV**](../cv), or the links below.
<!-- I gained extensive expertise in data collection-analysis-presentation, working in very different settings ---from private consulting to multilateral development banks, to NGOs and government. -->

--- 

I love {{< fa brands r-project >}} and the culture of collaborative, reproducible and open research ecosystem that this programming language promotes. This website showcases some of my recent [**projects**](https://luisamimmi.org/projects/), mostly involving **R programming** for analyzing, modelling and visualizing data. I also link some **static websites** I created as tools for organizing and disseminating various data and/or technical content (in English 🇺🇸 and Italian 🇮🇹). 

<!-- As a life-long learner, I enjoy studying new things and writing as a way of reflecting on interesting ideas or new skills I am learning. Hence this [**blog**](https://luisamimmi.org/blog/) page.    -->

---

As a **freelance consultant**, I currently support institutional clients, academic researchers and individual professionals in their **statistics and data analysis endeavors**. I bring an analytical foundation to projects, and help making data-driven decision regardless of the sector or size of the organization. I have also successfully delivered lectures and workshops on statistics, data analysis and visualization. 

[Feel free to reach out to explore potential collaboration with any statistics, data analysis, or R endeavors.]{style="color:  #7f6b00; font-weight: bold;"}
