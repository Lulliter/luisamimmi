## Welcome to my website!  

[I am a Policy & Data Analyst, freelance consultant, and {{< fa brands r-project >}} enthusiast.]{style="color:  #7f6b00; font-weight: bold;"}

I am an economist with extensive experience (in Italy 🇮🇹 and in the US 🇺🇸) in empirical research projects within the fields of **economic development and impact evaluation of public economic policies**. My research focus is at the intersection of *public policy* and *statistics*. 
<!-- As a life-long learner, I enjoy studying new things and writing as a way of reflecting on interesting ideas or new skills I am learning. Hence this [**blog**](https://luisamimmi.org/blog/) page.    -->
You can learn more about my background and publications via the [**research**](../writings) page, my [**CV**](../cv), or the links below.
<!-- I gained extensive expertise in data collection-analysis-presentation, working in very different settings ---from private consulting to multilateral development banks, to NGOs and government. -->

As a **freelance consultant**, I currently support institutional clients, academic researchers and individual professionals in their **statistics and data analysis endeavors**. I bring an analytical foundation to projects, and help making data-driven decision regardless of the sector or size of the organization. I also love teaching and I have successfully delivered lectures and workshops on statistics, data analysis and visualization. 

Here are some illustrative [**projects**](https://luisamimmi.org/projects/).

[Feel free to reach out to explore potential collaboration with any statistics, data analysis, or R endeavors.]{style="color:  #7f6b00; font-weight: bold;"}
