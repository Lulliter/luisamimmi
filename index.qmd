## 👋🏻 Hi there! 👋🏻

[I am Luisa, a Policy & Data Analyst, freelance consultant, and {{< fa brands r-project >}} enthusiast.]{style="color:  #7f6b00; font-weight: bold;"}

My professional focus lies at the intersection of *Economics*, *Public Policy* and *Data Science*. In over 20 years of experience (in Italy and in the US), I have worked on the entire analytic cycle (data collection-analysis-presentation) for several research projects within the fields of **economic development** and the evaluation of public economic policies.   

You can learn more about my background and academic publications via the links below, the [**research**](../writings) page, or my [**CV**](../cv).
<!-- I gained extensive expertise in data collection-analysis-presentation, working in very different settings ---from private consulting to multilateral development banks, to NGOs and government. -->

--- 

As a **freelance consultant**, I currently support institutional clients (like the Italian Government), academic researchers and individual professionals in their **statistics and data analysis endeavors**. 
With my contribution I bring an analytical foundation to projects, and help making data-driven decision regardless of the sector, core business or size of the organization. I have also successfully delivered talks and workshops on statistics and reproducible quantitative research. 

---

This website showcases some of my recent [**projects**](https://luisamimmi.org/projects/), mostly involving **R programming** for data analysis and/or the creation of **static websites** for data and/or technical content dissemination (in English 🇺🇸 and Italian 🇮🇹). 

<!-- As a life-long learner, I enjoy studying new things and writing as a way of reflecting on interesting ideas or new skills I am learning. Hence this [**blog**](https://luisamimmi.org/blog/) page.    -->

[Feel free to reach out if you think I can collaborate with you or your team with any statistics, data analysis, or R projects.]{style="color:  #7f6b00; font-weight: bold;"} 

<!-- If you want to work with me as a collaborator, supervisor, instructor, or public speaker, drop me a message: -->
