## Welcome to my website!  

[I am a Policy & Data Analyst, freelance consultant, and {{< fa brands r-project >}} enthusiast.]{style="color:  #7f6b00; font-weight: bold;"}

I have extensive experience (in Italy ðŸ‡®ðŸ‡¹ and in the US ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¸) with empirical research projects in the fields of **economic development and impact evaluation of public economic policies**. My research interest is at the intersection of *public policy* and *statistics*. 
<!-- As a life-long learner, I enjoy studying new things and writing as a way of reflecting on interesting ideas or new skills I am learning. Hence this [**blog**](https://luisamimmi.org/blog/) page.    -->
You can learn more about my background and publications via my [**CV**](../cv), or the links below.

<!-- the [**research**](../writings) page,  -->
<!-- I gained extensive expertise in data collection-analysis-presentation, working in very different settings ---from private consulting to multilateral development banks, to NGOs and government. -->

As a **freelance consultant**, I currently support institutional clients, academic researchers and individual professionals in their **statistics and data analysis endeavors**. I bring an analytical foundation to projects, and help making data-driven decision regardless of the sector or size of the organization.  
I especially enjoy teaching and have successfully delivered **lectures and workshops** on statistics, reproducible data analysis, and visualization. 

Here are some illustrative [**projects**](https://luisamimmi.org/projects/).

[I am open to collaborate on projects involving data and statistical analysis, program evaluation, or R programming/training.]{style="color:  #7f6b00; font-weight: bold;"}
