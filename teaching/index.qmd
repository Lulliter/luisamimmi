### Introductory workshop on *"R for Biostatistics"* (July 2024)

[{{< fa up-right-from-square >}} Project website](https://R4biostats.com) \| [{{< fa brands github >}} Source Code](https://github.com/Lulliter/R4biostats)

This website collects the materials for a four day workshop organized by [MITGEST Doctoral Network](https://www.mitgest.eu/) in July 2024. The workshop is offered as part of a summer school for EU doctoral biology students, hosted by the Radboud Center for Mitochondrial Medicine, in Nijmegen, Netherlands. My sister ([M. Chiara Mimmi, Ph.D.](https://www.linkedin.com/in/maria-chiara-mimmi-b0aa9233/)), is in charge of the workshop, while I co-created the materials for the R practice sessions, plus the course website.

### Seminar on *"Reproducible Data Analysis"* (July 2023)

[{{< fa up-right-from-square >}} Slides](Reproducibility_Compressed.pdf)

This seminar (titled _Principi, tecniche e strumenti per lâ€™analisi riproducibile dei dati_) is an introduction to reproducible data analysis, I offered to the PNRR Unit, within the Presidency of the Ministries Council, Rome. The seminar covers principles, techniques, and tools for reproducible data analysis.

### Lessons learned from a pilot study on *"Willingness to pay for legal electricity among slum residents"* (April 2012)

[{{< fa up-right-from-square >}} Slides](Mumbai.pdf)

This lesson was an internal training initiatives in which I shared with my team the World Bank some lessons learned from a pilot study conducted on slum electrification in Mumbai. The lesson focused on the sampling methodology and the estimation of willingness to pay for infrastructure services, based on a household survey conducted in 4 urban slums of Mumbai.
